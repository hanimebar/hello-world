just learning
So I decided to follow through with the lesson.  I don't know if I will suck at data science or be a god at it, but either way, I will still be way better than everyone I know hehehe.  The goal is to become more marketable to find work, even though I am insanely experienced.  This will add more fire to my skillset - no fact-based research here - but even if it doesn't I think it will be fun.
